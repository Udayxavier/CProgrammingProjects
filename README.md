# CProgrammingProjects
This repository showcases my journey in learning and practicing C programming through various projects. Each project focuses on different aspects of C, helping me build a strong foundation in problem-solving, user input handling, and efficient coding practices.

First project: I completed this C programming assignment to enhance my foundational C skills. The project involved implementing three programs: a unit converter (converter.c), an integer-to-English translator (int_to_english.c), and a date comparison program (earliest_date.c). These tasks helped me strengthen my understanding of user input handling, conditional logic, and structured programming while reinforcing good coding practices such as clear variable naming, proper commenting, and efficient program flow.

Second project: I completed this C programming assignment to enhance my focus on sorting algorithms and performance measurement. The program, `sorting.c`, prompts the user to input numbers and fills the rest of an array with randomly generated values. Users can choose between **Quick Sort** and **Bubble Sort**, with execution time measured using the `time()` function. The program displays the original and sorted arrays along with sorting duration. Users can re-generate numbers, enter new values, or switch sorting algorithms through an interactive menu. This project strengthened my understanding of **array manipulation, function modularity, and algorithm efficiency**.

Third project: I completed this C programming assignment to enhance my focus on designing a reminder management system.(for November in this particular case using a multi-file structure) The program consists of main.c, reminder.c, and reminder.h, where users can input reminders for specific days, store them, and display a calendar with visual indicators for days with reminders. The implementation follows structured programming practices, including struct usage, function modularity, and global variable management. Users can continuously add reminders and view an updated calendar. This project strengthened my understanding of multi-file program organization, structured data storage, and user interaction in

Fourth project: I completed this C programming assignment to extend my understanding of structures, dynamic memory allocation, multi-file program organization, file I/O operations, and error handling. This project builds upon the previous reminder management system by adding features such as automatic month detection, multiple reminders per day using linked lists, persistent storage for reminders, and handling external interrupts (SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGSEGV). Additionally, the assignment required creating a Makefile for efficient compilation and debugging. This project helped strengthen my skills in modular programming, data structures, and system-level programming in C.

Bonus project: I completed this C programming assignment to develop a Linux command-line tool (gcal) for managing reminders. This project extends previous work by implementing functionalities such as adding, removing, and viewing reminders via command-line arguments. It also involved Makefile creation, environment setup, and automation through a shell script (install.sh), ensuring the tool could be installed and accessed globally. This assignment strengthened my skills in file handling, argument parsing, process automation, and system-level programming in C.
